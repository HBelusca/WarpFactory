# WarpFactory - A numerical toolkit for analyzing warp drive spacetimes.

Warp Factory is a set of functions written in MATLAB which is designed to model warp spacetimes using Einstein's theory of General Relativity. Its development is focused on providing a numerical framework to analyze the physicality of spacetime, which is a unique focus in the development of warp solutions. 

## Key Features of Warp Factory
Energy condition evaluations for the point-wise Null, Weak, Dominant, and Strong
Metric scalar evaluation for the shear, expansion, and vorticity. 
3D finite difference solver for the stress-energy tensor
GPU utilization
