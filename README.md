WarpFactory is a powerful numerical toolkit written in MATLAB for analyzing warp drive spacetimes using Einstein's theory of General Relativity. Its unique focus lies in providing a numerical framework to analyze the physicality of spacetime.

## Key Features

- 3D finite difference solver for the stress-energy tensor
- Energy condition evaluations for the point-wise Null, Weak, Dominant, and Strong Energy Conditions
- Metric scalar evaluation for the shear, expansion, and vorticity
- Momentum flow visualizations
- GPU utilization for accelerated computations

## Documentation

For comprehensive documentation and usage instructions, please visit the [WarpFactory Documentation](https://applied-physics.gitbook.io/warp-factory).

## Installation

To set up WarpFactory, follow these steps:

1. Install Git from the official [Git website](https://git-scm.com/).
2. Install MATLAB from the official [MATLAB website](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html). During installation, ensure that you select the "Parallel Computing Toolbox" component.
3. Clone the WarpFactory repository: git clone https://github.com/NerdsWithAttitudes/WarpFactory.git
4. Launch MATLAB and navigate to the cloned project folder.
5. Add the project folder and its subfolders to the MATLAB path.
